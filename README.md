# IOT-Project-HomeAutomation
PRESENT STATUS
This project is based on application of Node.JS and angularJS for development of web Automation system. The server side is based on Nodejs and the 
client side is controlled by angular js. Presently it show weather data, weather forecast, google news feeds and google Calender. here also the
room temperature is sensed by an temperature sensor which is processed by an Arduino board and sent to the USB port of computer. on receiving 
the temperature it is shown to the client utilising the two way data binding of angular js.

FUTURE GOALS
to install nodejs in raspberry pi and build a prototype of full fledged home automation system which can control electrical applicances 
via web. Sensors like motion detecctors, humdity sensor, gas sensor etc will be incorporated to the project. Incorporation of real time controllers
is the next immediate target.
